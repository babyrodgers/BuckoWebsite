	<h5>Listen to the new single off of the upcoming EP <a href="https://okbucko.bandcamp.com/album/ok-bucko-ep">THEY LIVE!!!!!!</a></h5>
    <p>Ok Bucko is a Seattle based power-pop band. They reach through the past to construct music for the modern moment. 
		On this uppcoming self-titled EP, Ok Bucko melds their influences from DIY punk to shoegaze and grunge; pulling along everyone 
		who can get down with a catchy hook and fuzzy guitars. Ok Bucko is Miranda Hardy on guitar and vocals, Chelsea Rodgers on keys and
		backing vocals, Khyre Matthews on bass, and Zeke Bender on drums.
		</p>
		<p>
		What's Ok in Bucko world? They are about to release their second EP and a double EP cassette on Youth Riot Records!
		Listen to the single, "They Live" OUT NOW. If you like what you see (and hear), follow them on
			the internet to stay in the Bucko loop.</p>
