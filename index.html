	<h5>Listen to our debut single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYxQgzrJtXk">WINDOW!!!!!!</a></h5>
    <p>Seattle based Ok Bucko cooks up sludgy power pop laced
		with the terror of a crumbling society, catchy hooks, and
		biting vocals. They serve all with a heavy side of TV
		references and absurdity.
		</p>
		<p>
		Through Miranda Hardy’s crunchy guitar, Khyre
		Matthew’s ripping bass, and Zeke Bender’s dynamic
		drumming; Chelsea Rodgers’ keys and Hardy’s vocals
		add a sweet urgency to an already boiling pot.
	</p>
	<p></p>
		Ok Bucko has been a long time in the making. The band
		arose out of the friendship of Hardy, Matthews, and
		Bender. The three cut their teeth together in DIY music,
		spending their late teens and early 20s booking shows,
		touring the country, and recording music on their own
		terms. <em>Hardly Boys, Borscht Boys, Freddie Lee Toyoda
		and Titanic 2</em> are just some of the projects this friendship
		spans.
	</p>
	<p>
		Adding Rodgers to the mix expands the sonic capabilities
		of the group. Renewing curiosity and inspiring melodic
		experimentation, Rodgers has been essential in finding
		the sound of Ok Bucko. Paired with the rock-solid rhythm
		section anchored by Matthews’ and Bender’s decades
		long friendship, the group finds its groove and stays there.</p>
